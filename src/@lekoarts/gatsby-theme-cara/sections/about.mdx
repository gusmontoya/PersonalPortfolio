# About 

        As a healthcare profesional, before tech I tended to the medical needs of the underserved and 
    under represented in my community. I started a 3D printing company for surgeons to better economically 
    serve our patients.

In 2021, I took a leap and trained in Full Stack development at Nucamp coding bootcamp. I quickly absorbed new concepts, while bringing ambitious ideas and a positive attitude to every challenge.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually tutoring HTML and CSS, riding my training bicycle, or participating in Google Developer Group's.
